# Afterpulsing-Analysis
This is a method of performing analysis on data from a Tpx3Cam Camera to ger results pertaining mainly to afterpusling. This analysis will provide many plots neeeded for afterpulsing analysis including histograms of various data values like the x and y positions of hits on the camera, ToA (time of Arrival), ToT (Time over Threshold) and more. This analysis will also provide 2d histograms of dx and dy (difference in x and y values between successive hits), all of the final plots produced from this analsyis will return different versions for both corrected data values and non corrected values. The respective plots are sent to their own separate, labeled folders which the code also produces for you. The most significant results this analsyis produces are histograms of the time difference and distance values of successive hits. These histograms provide the afterpulsing fraction given in percent form and produces a shaded region for the region you choose as the access region (region of the data where afterpulsing occurs).
