# Afterpulsing-Analysis
This is a method for performing specific analysis to study effects of after pulsing using SPAD detectors. This method of analysis uses python classes to try to speed up time in obtaining results. There are 2 separate .py files, one is intended for use with a single data file and the other is intended for use with multiple data files. These .py files can and should be modified as needed to fit specific data, and since this uses class methods, it should be easy to either add new functions to the .py files or to perform different analysis pulling out data from the classes as you wish.
